\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}
We have researched the competition of two layer networks. To begin with, competing interconnected networks were introduced to have different dynamics on each layer. And some indexes were provided to measure how the network state is changed and evaluate the consensus on two layer. Based on this modeling, various simulations were implemented according to 3 main topics.
\begin{itemize}
\item Competition on two layer with different structural network
\item Competition on two layer with different updating rules
\item Finding key nodes on two layer networks
\end{itemize}
